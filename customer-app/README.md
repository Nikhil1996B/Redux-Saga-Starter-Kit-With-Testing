#Blocommerce Front End code base

##Libraries used
React for view components
Redux for state management
fetch API polyfill for HTTP requests

##Adding a new dependency
run yarn add <Dependency-name> in root folder of frontend code where +package.json is located. use --dev if it is a development dependency
This will result in mainly three changes which must be checked-in to repo
changes in offline-mirror
changes in yarn.lock ( according to git it is a binary file )
changes in package.json
